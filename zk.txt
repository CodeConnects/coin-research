The math on ZK rollups is intense!! They are very powerful, so good possibility jobs will be in demand.

Dusk is always lagging, but people seem to love it. Algod is a big supporter, and there are other CT folks too.

Mina, Loopring, Aleph Zero, Boba and Metis. Look deeper into these.

Rumor has it that Matic is integrating ZK. Matic seems like trash, but they keep doing more, so maybe that bias is off.

--------------------------------

Two types: ZK and Optimistic

Optimistic assumes trasactions are correct, so time to finality is something crazy like a week or two

ZK has quick finality, but has very complex math under the hood, so are not ready for production yet
