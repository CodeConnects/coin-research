In general, AI makes existing processes more efficient. Some examples:

Automation: Many large and small processes can be simplified and accelerated with AI in the future. This ranges from analyzing which cryptos are a good investment opportunity to automatically compiling data.

Fraud detection: Artificial intelligence can recognize conspicuous patterns that warn users, for example, of suspicious wallet addresses or a high probability of scams with certain crypto projects.

Autonomous processes: Smart contracts allow the execution of complex processes on blockchains. Thanks to AI, this could be taken to a new level in the future. For example, when smart contracts are automatically adapted or newly created on the basis of certain specifications.

User experience: Artificial intelligence can recognize behavior and usage patterns and offer or optimize certain functions and services on this basis. An example is the automatic and correct filling of transaction forms.
