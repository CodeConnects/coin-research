We have an idea for ETH denver and looking for a team member with AR and AI experience and also a front end whiz. Something really cool that will be fun to build with a lot of potential, with real utility. DMs open.

Gm! I'm a fullstack developer and web2 entrepreneur working in the field for 10+ years. I've been experimenting with Solidity/Smart Contracts for the past 8 months or so and during that period I participated in 4 ETH hackathons with awarded projects in all events (mostly NFT and DeFi projects). For ETHDenver, I have a project idea to propose a reverse logistics framework for the e-waste supply chain using blockchain. I believe this would fit well in the "Impact + Public Goods" track. Looking for buidlers with complementary skill sets to work on that. If it sounds interesting to you, send me a DM! My contact info: https://linktr.ee/ateves

For the team I’m working on, we have 3 folks and are in need of a frontend dev, preferably one that can handle inputs and controls and/or UI. Think the complexity of games. After we find this person, it’s time to brainstorm use cases and potential projects, whoo! Hi all! @MemeBrains and I are working on a protocol & platform to help DAOs and online communities with governance, participation, treasury replenishment and revenue generation.
We both have had successful business exits in the past and have been working together on Web3 ventures in the last couple of years. Memebrains has a business background and is great at building communities, running podcasts and spaces, presentations, etc. My background is in tech, building from scratch to scale and managing dev teams in both B2B and B2C spaces. If anyone wants to join us for ETHDenver to help with Product, UI design, frontend or backend development (nextjs, node.js, solidity, graphql, etc) and community building, we would love to chat with you!
